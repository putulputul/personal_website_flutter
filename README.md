<p align="center">
  This is a sample GitHub repository for a WooCommerce Flutter app that utilizes REST API and Bloc pattern for state management.
</p>

## Overview

<p align="center">
  This app demonstrates how to build a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter to interact with the WooCommerce API and manage state with the Bloc pattern. It allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, and make purchases through the WooCommerce online store.
</p>

## Features

- Product listing: Display a list of products fetched from the WooCommerce API.
- Product details: Show detailed information about a selected product.
- Add to cart: Allow users to add products to their shopping cart.
- Cart management: Users can view and modify the contents of their shopping cart.
- Checkout: Provide a seamless checkout experience using the WooCommerce API.

## Installation

<p align="center">
  Follow these steps to set up the project:
</p>

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/woocommerce-flutter-app.git
Open the project in your preferred Flutter development environment (Android Studio, VS Code, etc.).

Install the dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
Create a new file named config.dart in the lib folder to store your WooCommerce API credentials:
dart
Copy code
// lib/config.dart

const String baseUrl = 'https://your-woocommerce-store-url.com/wp-json/wc/v3/';
const String consumerKey = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY';
const String consumerSecret = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET';
Replace YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY and YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET with your actual WooCommerce API credentials. You can obtain these credentials from your WooCommerce store's admin panel.

</p>
Models: Contains the data models used in the app, such as Product, CartItem, etc.

Providers: Contains the ProductProvider and CartProvider classes responsible for handling API calls and managing state related to products and the shopping cart.

Blocs: Contains the ProductBloc and CartBloc classes that handle the business logic and interact with the providers.

Screens: Contains the different screens of the app, such as the product listing screen, product details screen, and cart screen.

Widgets: Contains various reusable widgets used throughout the app.

Please refer to the code and documentation in each file to understand how the different components work together.
